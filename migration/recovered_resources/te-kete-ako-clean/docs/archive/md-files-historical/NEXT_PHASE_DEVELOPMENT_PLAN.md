# Te Kete Ako - Next Phase Development Plan

## Strategic Roadmap for Educational Platform Excellence

*Last Updated: August 1, 2025*  
*Status: Ready for Next Agent Implementation*

---

## 🎯 **CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS**

### ✅ **What's Working:**

- **216 educational resources** fully enriched with external links
- Clean, optimized codebase with GraphRAG integration
- Cultural authenticity framework established
- Production deployment pipeline functional
- Core platform architecture solid

### ⚠️ **Critical Issues Identified:**

1. **Authentication Problems:** Supabase API keys causing intermittent failures
2. **Underutilized Assets:** Many files in codebase not being maximized
3. **Placeholder Content:** Māori cultural content needs authentic replacement
4. **Incomplete Lesson Packages:** Activities lack comprehensive printable resources
5. **NZ Curriculum Gaps:** Missing coverage across learning areas and phases

---

## 🚀 **PHASE 2 DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES**

### **TIER 1: CRITICAL FOUNDATIONS** (Immediate - 1-2 weeks)

#### 1. **AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM OVERHAUL**

- **Problem:** Supabase authentication failing despite API keys in codebase
- **Investigation Needed:**
  - Check environment variable loading in production
  - Verify Supabase project configuration
  - Test authentication flow end-to-end
  - Implement fallback authentication methods
- **Success Criteria:** 100% reliable sign-in/sign-up functionality

#### 2. **COMPREHENSIVE FILE AUDIT**

- **Audit ALL files** in Te-Kete-Ako-Clean directory structure
- **Identify:** Unused assets, incomplete implementations, hidden gems
- **Categories to review:**
  - `experiences/` directory utilization
  - `y8-systems/` integration opportunities  
  - Legacy lesson plans needing updates
  - Unused CSS/JS components
  - Incomplete handout templates
- **Output:** Complete asset inventory with utilization recommendations

#### 3. **AUTHENTIC MĀORI CONTENT REPLACEMENT**

- **Replace ALL placeholder Māori content** with culturally authentic material
- **Consultation Required:** Work with Māori educational advisors
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Whakataukī (proverbs) accuracy
  - Cultural context appropriateness
  - Te Reo Māori language correctness
  - Tikanga (customs) authenticity
- **Success Criteria:** All Māori content validated by cultural experts

### **TIER 2: CONTENT EXPANSION** (Weeks 3-6)

#### 4. **COMPREHENSIVE LESSON ACTIVITY PACKAGES**

Every lesson needs to be a **complete teaching package**:

```
📚 Standard Lesson Package Structure:
├── Lesson Plan (detailed, step-by-step)
├── Student Handouts (print-ready PDFs)
├── Assessment Rubrics
├── Extension Activities  
├── Differentiation Options
├── Digital Resources (interactive)
├── Cultural Connections (where appropriate)
└── Home Learning Links
```

**Implementation Strategy:**

- Start with highest-traffic lessons
- Create template system for rapid development
- Ensure all resources are print-optimized
- Include both digital and analog versions

#### 5. **NZ CURRICULUM GAP ANALYSIS & FILLING**

**Systematic approach:**

1. **Map current content** against full NZ Curriculum framework
2. **Identify gaps** across all 8 learning areas:
   - English
   - Mathematics and Statistics  
   - Science
   - Social Sciences
   - The Arts
   - Health and Physical Education
   - Learning Languages (Te Reo Māori focus)
   - Technology
3. **Prioritize gaps** by:
   - Teacher demand/requests
   - Curriculum importance
   - Cultural significance
4. **Create content** to fill priority gaps

#### 6. **MULTI-PHASE CONTENT CREATION**

**Revolutionary Approach:** Create lesson variants for different school phases

```
📈 Phase-Adapted Content System:
├── Early Years (Years 1-2)
├── Primary (Years 3-6)  
├── Intermediate (Years 7-8)
├── Junior Secondary (Years 9-10)
└── Senior Secondary (Years 11-13)
```

**Example:** "Treaty of Waitangi" lesson adapted for:

- **Years 1-2:** Story-based, visual, hands-on activities
- **Years 7-8:** Historical analysis, cause-and-effect
- **Years 11-13:** Critical evaluation, historiography, essay writing

**Implementation:** Use AI agents to systematically adapt existing high-quality content

### **TIER 3: INTERACTIVE FEATURES** (Weeks 7-12)

#### 7. **AUTOMATED EDUCATIONAL GAMES SYSTEM**

**Vision:** AI-generated, curriculum-linked games

**Game Types to Implement:**

- **Word Searches:** Vocabulary from any lesson/topic
- **Crosswords:** Key terms and concepts  
- **Matching Games:** Concepts to definitions
- **Quiz Games:** Multiple choice, true/false
- **Puzzle Games:** Logic and problem-solving
- **Cultural Games:** Māori language and culture focus

**Technical Approach:**

- Build game generation templates
- Link to lesson content automatically
- Ensure cultural appropriateness in Māori games
- Make all games print-friendly AND digital

#### 8. **ADVANCED AI TUTORING FEATURES**

- **Personalized Learning Paths:** Adapt to student progress
- **Intelligent Questioning:** Socratic method implementation
- **Cultural Responsiveness:** Māori pedagogical approaches
- **Assessment Integration:** Formative feedback loops
