# 📊 CROSS-SUBJECT RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION STANDARDS

**Te Kete Ako Platform - Intelligent Subject Organization Framework**  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** July 29, 2025  
**Purpose:** Define clear standards for categorizing resources across multiple subject areas

---

## 🎯 **CLASSIFICATION PRINCIPLE**

### **Core Challenge:**

All quality New Zealand educational resources integrate:

- **Te Ao Māori perspectives** (cultural responsiveness requirement)
- **Literacy skills** (reading, writing, communication across all subjects)
- **Numeracy applications** (mathematical thinking in all contexts)

### **Solution Framework:**

**PRIMARY SUBJECT CLASSIFICATION** based on dominant learning objectives and content focus, with **secondary subject tags** for cross-curricular integration.

## 🏷️ **SECONDARY SUBJECT TAGGING SYSTEM**

### **Multi-Subject Resource Strategy:**

Every resource receives:

1. **ONE Primary Subject Classification** (main category for discovery)
2. **Multiple Secondary Subject Tags** (cross-curricular connections)
3. **Integration Level Indicators** (how deeply other subjects are integrated)

### **Secondary Tag Examples:**

#### **Writer's Toolkit Unit (Primary: English)**

- **Secondary Tags**: General Education (transferable skills), Te Ao Māori (cultural examples)
- **Integration Levels**:
  - English: PRIMARY (90% - writing skills development)
  - General Education: HIGH (40% - transferable communication skills)
  - Te Ao Māori: MODERATE (15% - cultural examples in writing)

#### **Y8 Systems Unit (Primary: Social Studies)**

- **Secondary Tags**: Te Ao Māori (governance systems), Mathematics (systems modeling), English (comprehension)
- **Integration Levels**:
  - Social Studies: PRIMARY (75% - how systems shape society)
  - Te Ao Māori: HIGH (35% - Māori governance systems)
  - English: MODERATE (25% - reading comprehension activities)
  - Mathematics: LOW (10% - basic graphing and modeling)

#### **Digital Pūrākau (Primary: Te Ao Māori)**

- **Secondary Tags**: English (storytelling), Digital Technology (interactive platform), General Education (creativity)
- **Integration Levels**:
  - Te Ao Māori: PRIMARY (85% - cultural storytelling and traditional knowledge)
  - English: HIGH (40% - narrative structure and language arts)
  - Digital Technology: MODERATE (20% - platform interaction)
  - General Education: LOW (10% - creative expression)

## 📊 **RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION WORKFLOW**

### **Step 1: Primary Subject Determination**

```python
def determine_primary_subject(resource):
    content_analysis = analyze_learning_objectives(resource)
    time_allocation = calculate_subject_focus_percentage(resource)
    assessment_focus = identify_primary_assessment_domain(resource)
    
    if content_analysis['te_ao_maori'] >= 50 and cultural_level in ['essential', 'high']:
        return 'Te Ao Māori'
    elif content_analysis['english'] >= 50 and assessment_focus == 'language_arts':
        return 'English'  
    elif content_analysis['social_studies'] >= 50 and assessment_focus == 'social_inquiry':
        return 'Social Studies'
    # ... continue for all subjects
    else:
        return 'General Education'  # Default for cross-curricular resources
```

### **Step 2: Secondary Subject Tagging**

```python
def generate_secondary_tags(resource, primary_subject):
    secondary_tags = []
    integration_levels = {}
    
    for subject in ALL_SUBJECTS:
        if subject != primary_subject:
            integration_percentage = calculate_integration_level(resource, subject)
            if integration_percentage >= 30:
                secondary_tags.append(subject)
                integration_levels[subject] = categorize_integration_level(integration_percentage)
    
    return secondary_tags, integration_levels
```

### **Step 3: Integration Level Categorization**

- **HIGH Integration (30-49%)**: Substantial focus, could almost be primary
- **MODERATE Integration (15-29%)**: Clear connections and support
- **LOW Integration (5-14%)**: Basic connections or examples
- **MINIMAL Integration (<5%)**: Token mentions only

### **Assessment Tools**

**Primary Classification Rule**: Based on assessment domain

- **Cultural Competency Rubrics** → PRIMARY: Te Ao Māori (cultural understanding assessment)
- **Writing Assessment Rubrics** → PRIMARY: English (language arts assessment)
- **Cross-Curricular Rubrics** → PRIMARY: General Education (transferable skills assessment)

### **Interactive Platforms**

**Primary Classification Rule**: Based on dominant content and learning objectives

- **Digital Pūrākau** → PRIMARY: Te Ao Māori (cultural storytelling focus)
- **Virtual Marae** → PRIMARY: Te Ao Māori (cultural protocol learning)
- **Society Design Tool** → PRIMARY: Social Studies (social organization focus)

## 🔍 **DISCOVERY IMPLICATIONS**

### **User Journey Scenarios:**

#### **Teacher Searching by Primary Subject:**

- **Te Ao Māori search** → Shows Digital Pūrākau, Māori Astronomy, Cultural Protocols
- **English search** → Shows Writer's Toolkit, Literary Analysis, Communication Skills
- **Social Studies search** → Shows Y8 Systems, Treaty Analysis, Social Justice units

#### **Teacher Searching by Secondary Integration:**

- **"Māori integration in English"** → Shows Writer's Toolkit resources with cultural examples
- **"Mathematics in Social Studies"** → Shows Y8 Systems modeling activities
- **"Cross-curricular literacy"** → Shows reading components in Science and Social Studies

#### **GraphRAG Semantic Search:**

- **"Traditional knowledge and mathematics"** → Finds Traditional Navigation Mathematics (Math primary) AND Whakapapa Mathematical Thinking (Te Ao Māori primary)
- **"Writing with cultural perspectives"** → Finds Writer's Toolkit (English primary) AND Cultural storytelling resources (Te Ao Māori primary)

## 📏 **QUALITY ASSURANCE STANDARDS**

### **Classification Review Process:**

1. **Cultural Guardian (Kaitiaki) Review**: Validates all Te Ao Māori primary classifications
2. **Master Teacher (Kaiako) Review**: Confirms educational alignment and curriculum connections
3. **Content Curator Review**: Ensures consistent application of classification standards
4. **Community Validation**: Te Ao Māori resources require community partnership validation

### **Edge Case Resolution:**

- **50/50 Split Resources**: Default to subject with strongest assessment focus
- **Three-Way Integration**: Choose subject with primary learning objective, tag other two as HIGH secondary
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: When in doubt, elevate to Te Ao Māori primary if cultural content is significant

### **Ongoing Maintenance:**

- **Quarterly Review**: Reassess classifications based on teacher usage patterns
- **Community Feedback**: Adjust Te Ao Māori classifications based on cultural community guidance  
- **Curriculum Alignment**: Update classifications when NZ Curriculum changes
- **Usage Analytics**: Refine secondary tagging based on actual cross-curricular discovery patterns
